# Design notes

Durable design decisions and their rationale. (Feature-level support claims live in
[SPEC.md](SPEC.md); this file records *why* the architecture is shaped the way it is.)

## The Store abstraction

All format logic is written against a key→bytes interface (`Store`) with a three-mode
`read_range` (full / slice / suffix-length). The suffix mode exists so a trailing shard
index can be fetched in one round-trip without knowing the object size — the shape of an
HTTP `Range: bytes=-n` request. `std::filesystem` lives only in
`adapters/filesystem_store.hpp`; WASM builds omit it and the core compiles unchanged.

**The Store interface is deliberately synchronous.** `read`/`read_range`/`write` return
their result directly, not a future. This is what keeps the core single-threaded and
WASM-clean — no event loop, no coroutine runtime, no threading assumptions baked into the
format logic — and it is why the whole library embeds cleanly into a host that owns its own
concurrency. The cost lands on consumers whose real I/O is asynchronous (a browser's
`fetch`): they must bridge async-to-sync at the Store boundary. Two standard bridges:

- **Emscripten Asyncify** — compile with `-sASYNCIFY`; a synchronous `read` inside the Store
  can then suspend the WASM stack while a JS `await fetch(...)` runs. Simplest; adds some
  code size and per-call overhead.
- **Worker + `SharedArrayBuffer`** — run libzarr on a Web Worker and satisfy each blocking
  Store call by posting the request to the main thread and blocking on `Atomics.wait` over a
  shared buffer until the fetch resolves. More moving parts, no Asyncify overhead, and it
  keeps the UI thread free.

Batching (`Store::read_many`) composes with either: the Store still blocks, but it can issue
the whole set of ranges concurrently (or coalesced) before returning, cutting round-trips
without changing the synchronous contract.

## Codec pipeline

Codec chains are resolved once per array into an executable plan (`CodecPipeline`),
partitioned per the v3 model: array→array*, exactly one array→bytes, bytes→bytes*. v2
metadata is *lowered* into this model at parse time (compressor → one bytes→bytes codec,
`order:"F"` → a transpose codec, dtype byte order → the `bytes` codec's endian), so
everything downstream is version-blind. No-op stages (identity transpose, native-endian
bytes) are elided at resolve time.

## Sharding: a Store adapter, not a codec

Byte ranges into a shard must map 1:1 onto stored bytes — that is the whole point of the
format — so `sharding_indexed` is modeled as an I/O adapter, not as a stage in the codec
pipeline. Metadata parsing lowers it into `ArrayMeta::shard_levels`, and `Array` wraps the
store in a `ShardStore` adapter per level: a shard is simply the outer chunk's stored
object, and the adapter maps inner-chunk keys onto byte ranges of it via the shard index.
Consequences:

- The array machinery is unaware of sharding; chunk I/O, byte-range sub-chunk reads, and
  fill handling work unchanged at inner-chunk granularity.
- **Nested sharding falls out for free**: `ShardStore` wrapping `ShardStore`, with level-N
  entry reads becoming level-N−1 range reads.

The index is a `16·n + 4(crc32c)`-byte block, `n` = inner chunks per shard: `[offset,
nbytes]` uint64 LE pairs in C order, offsets relative to the shard start, `2^64−1` sentinels
marking missing chunks. It sits at the end of the shard, or at the start for
`index_location: start`.

**Read path costs.** One suffix (or prefix, for `index_location: start`) range request per
shard for the index — cached in a 16-entry LRU — plus one range request per inner chunk
read. Peak memory: one decoded index (`16·n_inner` bytes) plus one encoded+decoded inner
chunk. A shard is never read whole on the read path.

**Write path costs.** Writes assemble whole shards in memory (read-modify-write: one full
read of the existing shard seeds the assembly). Peak memory: the encoded bytes of all inner
chunks of one shard plus its index — i.e. one shard object — and transiently ~2× that when
seeding from an existing shard. The assembly flushes when writes move to another shard and
at the end of every `Array` write operation. All-fill shards are erased rather than stored.

**Write amplification.** Whole-array writes iterate inner chunks in C order, so a shard
spanning `r` rows of inner chunks is assembled and rewritten `r` times. Read-modify-write
keeps this correct; a shard-major write order (assemble each shard once) would eliminate the
rewrites. The amplification is measurable on uncompressed sharded writes and negligible
under any real compressor (see the baseline below).

**Enforcement.** `index_codecs` are restricted to `bytes` (+ optional `crc32c`) — the spec
requires a fixed-size encoded index. Codecs wrapped *around* a shard (outer transpose,
whole-shard compression) are rejected on read and write: byte ranges into the shard must map
1:1 onto stored bytes, which is the entire point of the format.

## Performance baseline

`bench/bench.cpp` (build Release, run manually), 64 MiB float32 array, chunks 256×256,
shards 1024×1024 where sharded, single-threaded over a MemoryStore. Representative figures
on a Xeon E5-2697 v3 @ 2.60 GHz (zlib 1.2.11, libzstd 1.4.4, c-blosc 1.21.6); rerun
`bench/bench.cpp` for your own hardware:

| case           | write MiB/s | read MiB/s | stored/raw |
|----------------|------------:|-----------:|-----------:|
| raw            |        2868 |       2595 |       1.00 |
| crc32c         |        1435 |       2018 |       1.00 |
| gzip-1         |          40 |        156 |       0.69 |
| gzip-5         |          19 |        159 |       0.65 |
| zstd-0         |          73 |        466 |       0.64 |
| blosc-lz4      |         932 |       1378 |       0.60 |
| sharded raw    |         506 |        620 |       1.00 |
| sharded zstd-0 |          70 |        342 |       0.64 |

Reading of the numbers: raw is memcpy-bound; compressed cases are codec-bound (the
uncompressed `raw` row is the pipeline-overhead ceiling). The `crc32c` row is not
CRC-bound — `detail::crc32c` dispatches at run time to the SSE4.2 CRC instruction (with a
portable table fallback off x86), so the row is pipeline/memcpy-bound like `raw`. The
sharded-raw gap vs raw (~5.7× write, ~4× read) has two sources: the C-order write path
reassembles each shard once per row of inner chunks (4× here, see write amplification
above), and each inner-chunk access pays key formatting/parsing plus an index lookup. The
shard index checksum is a negligible fraction of it, and the whole gap disappears under a
real compressor (zstd-0 sharded ≈ unsharded — both codec-bound). The optimizations that
would close it are shard-major write ordering and cheaper chunk-key handling in
`ShardStore::locate`.

## Consolidated metadata

v2 `.zmetadata` is read through automatically at root opens and kept in sync by every
metadata write. The v3 inline convention (zarr-specs #309) is read automatically but written
only by an explicit `zarr::v3::consolidate()` call — it is a convention, not yet an accepted
spec, so libzarr never emits it unasked.

## Error philosophy

Everything reachable from user input or store bytes throws `zarr::error` with a precise,
self-contained message; internal invariants use `assert`. Malformed input must never reach
undefined behavior — the fuzz harnesses (metadata documents, shard bytes) enforce this under
ASan/UBSan.
